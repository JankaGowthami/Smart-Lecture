Smart Lecture: Turning Classroom Text into Study-Ready Text

In the digital age, enhancing student engagement and comprehension is crucial for effective learning. Smart
Lecture automates the recording, transcription, and summarization of spoken lectures into concise, organized
text. The system employs Google Speech-to-Text for real-time transcription, the BART model for text
summarization, and a Flask-based web interface for accessibility. By reducing the need for manual notetaking,
this solution allows students to focus on understanding lectures and supports those who miss classes or require
material review. Smart Lecture bridges advanced machine learning and traditional teaching, providing scalable,
high-quality lecture summaries to improve the learning experience.
